# Movie-Recommendation-system
🔍 Objective

To develop an AI system that recommends movies to users based on their preferences using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid methods.

🧠 How It Works (AI Techniques Used)

1. Content-Based Filtering

Recommends movies similar to those a user has liked in the past.

Uses features like genre, director, cast, description, etc.

Example: If you like "Inception", it may recommend "Interstellar" (same director, genre).


2. Collaborative Filtering

Recommends based on the preferences of similar users.

Uses user-item interactions (ratings, views).

Example: "Users who liked this also liked…"


3. Hybrid Systems

Combines both content-based and collaborative methods.

More accurate and personalized.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)

MovieLens dataset (or IMDb data)

Flask/Django (for web deployment)

Streamlit (for interactive UI)

📊 Steps in Building the System

1. Data Collection – Collect data (movie info, ratings, etc.)


2. Preprocessing – Clean and prepare data


3. Feature Extraction – Extract keywords, genres, etc.


4. Model Training – Use ML models like KNN, SVD, or deep learning


5. Recommendation Engine – Generate suggestions


6. Evaluation – Accuracy using RMSE, MAE, Precision/Recall


7. Deployment – Web app or API
